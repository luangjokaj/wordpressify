## Features

- **DEV SERVER**
A development server for PHP based in Node. Powered by BrowserSync.
- **AUTO-RELOAD**
Watches for all your changes and reloads in real-time.
- **CSS**
Preprocessors: PostCSS or Sass with source maps.

# 1. Installing Node

WordPressify requires Node v7.5+. This is the only global dependency. You can download Node **[here](https://nodejs.org/)**.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

To install WordPressify you need to clone the repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/luangjokaj/wordpressify
```
- This will clone the repository on your local machine. Navigate to the newly created folder and install the dependencies:

**INSTALL DEPENDENCIES**

```
npm install
```

**CHANGE TEMPLATE NAME**

- At this point WordPressify is installed and ready to be used for the first time. Before starting, open **gulpfile.js** and edit your template name:

```javascript
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theme Name
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
const themeName = 'wordpressify';
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**INSTALL WORDPRESS**

- On the first run we need to install WordPress, we do this once by running the command:

```
npm run install:wordpress
```

- It will fetch the latest WordPress version, which is the build we use for the development server.

**START WORKFLOW**

- We are ready to start our development server with the command:

```
npm run dev
```

- If you are running a fresh instance of WordPress, the installation wizard will set up a **wp-config.php** file containing database credentials, site name etc.
- You are ready to go! Happy coding!

**WORDPRESS PLUGINS**

- If you want to add or build WordPress plugins, you can do that from the directory:

```
src/plugins/
```

**PRODUCTION TEMPLATE**

- To generate your distribution files run the command:

```
npm run prod
```

- The template will be saved as a zip file in:

```
dist/wordpressify.zip
```

**WINDOWS USERS**
- If you are running Windows, PHP has to be installed and configured. Check the [gulp-connect-php](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect-php) documentation. 

We prepared a video screencast **demonstrating the installation processs using a Windows** operating system, you can find it here: [How to install WordPressify on Windows?](https://www.wordpressify.co/windows-installation/)
Or check out this tutorial on [Medium](https://medium.com/@marcus.supernova/how-to-install-wordpressify-on-windows-4b78a801165b).

# 3. CSS, PostCSS and Sass
## PostCSS
By default WordPressify supports [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), a similar preprocessor to Sass, Less and others but with more functionality. On top of that PostCSS is 3x faster than Sass and 4x faster than Less. Features come in the shape of PostCSS plugins. Think of these like using Lego, where each piece is a different feature that can transform your CSS in some way. PostCSS lets you stick these pieces together so that you can build up your own feature set, adding and removing plugins as and when you need them. [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org//) is installed by default. Read more about PostCSS [here](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/postcss-a-review).

**POSTCSS PLUGINS**

WordPressify has two different sets of PostCSS plugins - one for the development environment (pluginsListDev) and one for the production task (pluginsListProd).

```javascript
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostCSS Plugins
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
const pluginsListDev = [
	partialimport,
	postCSSMixins,
	postcssPresetEnv({
		stage: 0,
		features: {
			'nesting-rules': true,
			'color-mod-function': true,
			'custom-media': true,
		},
	}),
];

const pluginsListProd = [
	partialimport,
	postCSSMixins,
	postcssPresetEnv({
		stage: 0,
		features: {
			'nesting-rules': true,
			'color-mod-function': true,
			'custom-media': true,
		},
	}),
	require('cssnano')({
		preset: ['default', {
			discardComments: false,
		}]
	}),
];
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**WRITING CSS**

The starting point for CSS is the file:

```
src/assets/styles/styles.css
```

The template definitions are located here too. It is also where all other imports are included in the stylesheets.

```
/*
Theme Name: WordPressify
Theme URI: https://www.wordpressify.co
Author: Luan Gjokaj
Author URI: https://www.riangle.com
Description: WordPressify official theme.
Version: 1.0
Tags: responsive, clean, minimal, modern, documentation
*/
```

## Sass
WordPressify is super flexible. You can install Sass and use it as the main CSS preprocessor:

```
npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
````

Include Sass in gulpfile.js:

```javascript
const sass = require('gulp-sass');
````

Change the gulp tasks stylesDev to:

```javascript
function stylesDev() {
	return src('./src/assets/styles/style.scss')
		.pipe(sourcemaps.init())
		.pipe(sass().on("error", sass.logError))
		.pipe(sourcemaps.write('.'))
		.pipe(dest('./build/wordpress/wp-content/themes/' + themeName))
		.pipe(browserSync.stream({ match: '**/*.css' }));
}
```

Also the watch task has to be changed in order to watch for .scss filetypes:

```javascript
watch('./src/assets/styles/**/*.scss', stylesDev);
```

Change the gulp tasks styleProd to:


```javascript
function stylesProd() {
	return src('./src/assets/styles/style.scss')
		.pipe(sass().on("error", sass.logError))
		.pipe(dest('./dist/themes/' + themeName));
}
```

# 4. Images and Fonts
## Images
It is recommended to store template image assets in your theme directory:

```
src/assets/img/
```

Ideally other images should be managed through the [Media Library](https://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Library_Screen) of WordPress. Try to only store SVG or minimal assets in your theme directory to keep the template as light as possible.

In the production build SVGs and other image assets will go through a **minification** process.

## Fonts
Fonts are always special. Your fonts should be stored in:

```
src/assets/fonts/
```

Then you can include them in your **CSS**:

```
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Thin';
	src: url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.eot?#iefix');
	src: url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.eot?#iefix') format('eot'),
	url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.woff2') format('woff2'),
	url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.woff') format('woff'),
	url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.ttf') format('truetype'),
	url('./fonts/Helvetica-Neue-Thin.svg#e3b7d1e7c160') format('svg');
}
```

# 5. JavaScript ES6

WordPressify supports ES6 JavaScript with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers. These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support.

## Write ES6 JavaScript
Your JavaScript code should be located in:

```
src/assets/js/
```

WordPressify will watch for changes under the js directory and bundle the code in a single file, which will be included in the footer of the page as:

```
footer-bundle.js
```
Check the gulp configuration to learn more about how JavaScript is generated.

# 6. External Libraries

Including external JavaScript libraries is as simple as installing the npm script and including it in the **gulpfile.js**

```javascript
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Header & Footer JavaScript Boundles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
const headerJS = [
	'./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js',
	'./node_modules/nprogress/nprogress.js',
	'./node_modules/aos/dist/aos.js',
	'./node_modules/isotope-layout/dist/isotope.pkgd.js'
];
const footerJS = [
	'./src/assets/js/**'
];
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

You can include the scripts in the head of the page before the DOM is loaded by placing them in the **headerJS** array or in the footer of the page after the DOM is loaded in the **footerJS** array. Only footer scripts are processed with Babel thus supporting ES6, however you can change this in the configuration if you want to run both header and footer scripts with Babel.

A build restart is required for changes to take effect.


# 7. Build Backups

While coding you will find yourself uploading dummy content to the WordPress build server, e.g. images or other media stored in **wp-content**. WordPressify allows you to back up the current state of the build which will include all server files. To back up your build run the command:

```
npm run backup
```

Files will be compressed in a zip file and stored in the directory:

```
backups/
```

# 8. Code Style Rules

WordPressify comes with its own set of code style rules that can be imported into IntelliJ. The code style file can be found in the directory:

```
tools/IntelliJ.xml
```

## Lint CSS

Before pushing changes make sure you have clean and consistent CSS. Run [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) with the command:
```
npm run lint:css
```

# 9. Database
## MySQL/MariaDB Server
After installing WordPressify you will still need a database to store WordPress content. The recommended solution is to install either [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) ([installation instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html)) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx) ([installation instructions](https://mariadb.com/products/get-started)) on your local machine.

## Remote Database
You are free to use remote databases. Please note that this will affect the speed depending on the connection.

# 10. Deployment
The recommended solution is to go with [WP Pusher](https://wppusher.com/). It is easy and quick to deploy automatically from GitHub or other services. The first step is to download the WordPress plugin from: https://wppusher.com/

Then navigate to your WordPress administration on your live site and install the downloaded plugin: Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin -> Install Now.

Activate the plugin and navigate to the plugin page **WP Pusher**. Click on the GitHub or any other tab and obtain a token by pressing the button on the page, then copy and save the token.

At this point go to your terminal, navigate to your WordPressify project and generate your distribution files with the command:
```
npm run prod
```

Navigate to your theme distribution files on: 
```
dist/theme/<themeName>
```
Create a git repository and push all the files on GitHub. This repository will have only the theme distribution files.

Once the files are on GitHub you can get back to the WordPress administration on the WP Pusher plugin page and follow the **Next Steps**, click on **Install a theme**.

On Repository host we choose GitHub, then click on **Pick from GitHub** and choose the newly created repository with the distribution files. Then install & activate the theme.

## Automated Deployments

**Push-to-Deploy** if you want automatic deployments to happen when you do a push to the distribution repository.
In this case you have to create a Webhook from your GitHub's repository page. 

First navigate to the WP Pusher plugin page and click on **Themes**, it will show you the list of the templates you have installed through the plugin itself. Click on **Show Push-to-Deploy URL** to get the Payload URL. 

Now get back to GitHub and navigate to your distribution repository and click on: Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook. Now past the URL and click **Add webhook**. 

This should enable automatic deployment on any push to the chosen GitHub repository.

**Note:** WP Pusher if **free** only with **public** repositories.

# 11. Cleanup Default Theme
The default theme comes as a theme sample to show how WordPressify combines everything together. If you want to remove the default theme type the command:
```
npm run fresh-start
```
This will **immediately** remove the default styles and leave a minimal viable theme with basic PHP WordPress loops and other useful features.

# 12. Windows Installation
**[How to install WordPressify on Windows?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ZNzKSeTSE)**

Assuming that you are using the latest version of Windows, and you have activated Windows Subsystem for Linux. Follow the instructions:
